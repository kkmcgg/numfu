# Numfu: The Numeric Way of the Flow

Unveil the mysteries of numeric computations through the lens of ancient Eastern wisdom.

## 📦 Installation

pip install numfu

## 📜 The Scroll of Numfu

<i>In the silent realms of the ancients, where whispers of wisdom still linger, Numfu reveals itself as an enigma, draped in shadows yet radiant with insight. As the adept navigates the labyrinth of its elusive 'moves', they embark on a journey: a dance between the tangible and the ethereal, the seen and the unseen. Just as a masterful strategist perceives the rhythm beneath the chaos of battle, so too does the practitioner of Numfu discern the patterns hiding within the maze of the unknown. It beckons, not to be merely used, but to be understood - an art, a philosophy, a way</i>

## 🎋 Pillars of Numfu

### 🌀 The Balance of Zero & One

In Numfu's realm, both void (0) and existence (1) hold significance. Mastery is in knowing, respecting, and utilizing this balance.

### 🌊 The Fluid Transformation

A Numfu sage shapes, bends, and orchestrates data with a fluid grace, akin to the timeless flow of a river sculpting the earth.

### 🌌 Cosmic Vision

With serenity and equilibrium, the Numfu adept discerns data's hidden constellations, revealing truths that evade the untrained eye.

### 🛠 Mastery Through Testing

Perfection is an endless pursuit. A Numfu master not only creates but continually refines and tests, ensuring harmony with the cosmic numeric dance.

# Moves (Standalone Functions)

1. **Fēng (风)**: *Wind* 
    - Reshape an array, giving it a new form without changing its data.

2. **Yuè (月)**: *Moon* 
    - Transpose the matrix, swapping rows with columns.

3. **Wǔ (五)**: *Five* 
    - Normalize array values, bringing them to a common scale.

4. **Lóng (龙)**: *Dragon* 
    - Apply a mathematical function over the array to enhance its values.

5. **Yǐn (隐)**: *Hidden* 
    - Extract a sub-array or specific indices from the original array.

6. **Fèn (凤)**: *Phoenix* 
    - Recycle and reuse memory from redundant arrays.

7. **Shān (山)**: *Mountain* 
    - Anchor or fix specific values in an array, making them immovable.

8. **Tiān (天)**: *Heaven/Celestial* 
    - Rotate or shift array elements along an axis.

9. **Hǔ (虎)**: *Tiger* 
    - Filter the array based on a condition or criteria.

10. **Lián (莲)**: *Lotus* 
    - Flatten or unravel nested arrays into a single dimension.

# Combos (Sequences of Moves)

1. **Fēng-Yuè Dance (风-月)** 
    - Reshape an array and then transpose it, combining flexibility with transformation.

2. **Lóng-Tiān Ascend (龙-天)** 
    - Enhance data values with a mathematical function and then rotate them, infusing and then redistributing energy.

3. **Yǐn-Shān Anchor (隐-山)** 
    - Extract specific values from an array and anchor them, spotlighting and cementing importance.

4. **Hǔ-Lián Unfold (虎-莲)** 
    - Filter specific values based on a condition and then flatten the result, refining and simplifying data.

5. **Wǔ-Fèn Renewal (五-凤)** 
    - Normalize an array's values and then recycle its memory, optimizing both data and resources.
