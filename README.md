- Determines if points are inside a specific polygon. If no polygon is provided, a random polygon is generated to test the points against. This move embodies the essence of being "within" or "inside".

### **Gōng (公)**: *Just, Honorable*
- This move graces data with the honor of aggregation, transforming individual data points into summarized representations based on spatial coordinates.

### **Zǐ (子)**: *Child, Son*
- Harmonizes two inputs, portraying their balanced difference. Like the relationship between a parent and child, it highlights the contrasts while emphasizing the underlying unity.

### **Shēng (生)**: *To Be Born, Life, Growth*
- Generates random values, either as integers or floats. It breathes life into data, giving birth to new values to enrich our analyses.

### **Dīng (定)**: *To Set, Decide*
- Applies filters to the data, refining its essence. This move is all about decision-making, selecting the best from the lot.

### **Jiàn (见)**: *To See, Appear*

### **Biāo (飙)**: *Whirlwind*
- Normalizes difference ratios, creating a whirlwind transformation of data. It emphasizes the spirit of agility and quickness.

### **Nián (捻)**: *Twist*
- Yet to be unveiled, this move holds the promise of intricately weaving data, twirling it into new formations.

### **Fàngshā (纺纱)**: *Spinning*
- Yet to be elucidated, this move whispers of crafting delicate threads of information, spinning raw data into intricate narratives.
